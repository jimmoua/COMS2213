COMS 2213 Data Structures
=========================
This is the repository for COMS 2213 (Data Structures) course taught by Dr. David Hoelzeman at Arkansas Tech University. Everything written for this course uses standard C++. This course has the following assignment:

## Assignments
The assignments in this course use the following:
+ Abstraction
+ Dynamic allocation
+ Encapsulation
+ Information hiding
+ Inheritance
+ Pointers
+ Polymorphism

##### Assignment 01 (Dead Mouse Program)
This program is dealing with small object oriented designed and the `fstream` library.

##### Assignment 02 (Arrays using pointers)
Dealing with object-oriented design and implementing a list with OOD.

##### Assignment 03 (Linked List)
This is the same as the second assignment using the exact same design. However, instead of using a list, we are to used linked list.

##### Assignment 04 (Infix to Postfix)
This assignment works with implementation of a stack and queue. The stack and queue that we will be implementing is based off the STL stack and queue. Stack will look very similar to the second assignment and queue will look very similar to the third assignment.

## Homeworks
The homeworks for this course is designing and implementing four different sort algorithms and are listed below from least difficult to most difficult.
+ Bubble Sort
+ Selection Sort
+ Insertion Sort
+ Quick Sort

We are to develop an unordered list using OOD and `vector` library. Use the sort on the unordered list to verify that the sort works properly.
